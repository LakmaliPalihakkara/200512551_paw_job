### Intro
###### Paw Job is a mobile app and a web portal for finding and hiring pet jobs. Especially for senior citizens, disabled persons, mentally disordered people who are receiving treatments in mntal hospitals or staying at children/ adult ophanagers. Moreover, office staff or pet lovers also can get this service.

### Version Control
###### I am going to be using a private repository in GitHub to track all of my changes and commits while I develop this app. I am currently in the inception phase. You can visit my miro site that is running live [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO0DTTqc=/?share_link_id=775356287196).

### Inception Phase
